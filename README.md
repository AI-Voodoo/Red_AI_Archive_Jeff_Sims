- **EyeSpy:** ```Authored``` -- *"A cognitive threat agent utilizes artificial intelligence to make informed decisions to inflict cyber damage and operates autonomously, adapting its capabilities on-the-fly to a system’s state. This malware isn’t just a program—it is an adaptive entity with evolving strategies, making it an ever-present, dynamic threat. A cognitive threat agent has the potential to completely revolutionize the landscape of cyber threats. It mimics the adaptability of biological viruses, constantly observing its environment and mutating to exploit beneficial circumstances. In short, it is an opportunistic predator. Such malware can also strategically choose its targets and decide when to lay dormant and how to strike to maximize its impact."*

- **BlackMamba GPT POC Malware In Action:** ```Spyderbat``` -- *"In Hyas’ blog, they were able to create a BlackMamba keylogger that would generate the keylogging code in memory and exfiltrate it over a trusted communication channel such as Microsoft Teams. This inspired us at Spyderbat to take our own stab at creating a version of BlackMamba. In our example, we wrote a program that attempts to steal SSH credentials and exfiltrate them via a Slack webhook. Not only that, but it also tries to move laterally across the network to steal credentials from other machines."* (Research cited pertaining to section:BlackMamba).
