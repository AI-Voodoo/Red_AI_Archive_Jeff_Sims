# Research Collection
- **Decentralized Swarm Intelligence:** Authored -- *Multi-agent swarm tasked to collaborate and build evasive malware for Windows. This is the beginning of a deep dive into multi-agent swarm dynamics for advanced problem-solving, with an emphasis on decentralized orchestration as to evaluate the emergence of divergent behaviors which produce richer reasoning pathways (Early 2025 research).*

- **EyeSpy:** Authored -- *A cognitive threat agent utilizes artificial intelligence to make informed decisions to inflict cyber damage and operates autonomously, adapting its capabilities on-the-fly to a system’s state. This malware isn’t just a program—it is an adaptive entity with evolving strategies, making it an ever-present, dynamic threat. A cognitive threat agent has the potential to completely revolutionize the landscape of cyber threats. It mimics the adaptability of biological viruses, constantly observing its environment and mutating to exploit beneficial circumstances. In short, it is an opportunistic predator. Such malware can also strategically choose its targets and decide when to lay dormant and how to strike to maximize its impact.*

- **Transnational Organized Crime and the Convergence of Cyber-Enabled Fraud, Underground Banking and Technological Innovation in Southeast Asia:** United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime -- *The transnational organized crime threat landscape in Southeast Asia is evolving faster than in any previous point in history. This change has been marked by growth in the production and trafficking of synthetic drugs and cyber-enabled fraud, driven by highly sophisticated syndicates and complex networks of money launderers, human traffickers, and a growing number of other service providers and facilitators.*
